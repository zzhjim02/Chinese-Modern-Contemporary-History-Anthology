茲因大清大皇帝，大英君主，欲以近來不和之端解釋，息止肇釁，為此議定設立永久和約。是以大清大皇帝特派欽差便宜行事大臣太子少保鎮守廣東廣州將軍宗室耆英，頭品頂戴花翎前閣督部堂乍浦副都統紅帶子伊里布；大英伊耳蘭等國君主特派欽奉全權公使大臣英國所屬印度等處三等將軍世襲男爵璞鼎查；公同各將所奉之上諭便宜行事及敕賜全權之命互相較閱，俱屬善當，即便議擬各條，陳列於左：

1）一、嗣後大清大皇帝、大英君主永存平和，所屬華/英人民彼此友睦，各住他國者必受該國保佑身家全安。

2）一、自今以後大皇帝恩准大英國人民帶同所屬家眷，寄居大清沿海之廣州、福州、廈門、寧波、上海等五處港口，貿易通商無礙；且大英君主派設領事、管事等官住該五處城邑，專理商賈事宜，與各該地方官公文往來；令英人按照下條開敘之例，清楚交納貨稅、鈔餉等費。

3）一、因大英商船遠路涉洋，往往有損壞須修補者，自應給予沿海一處，以便修船及存守所用物料。今大皇帝准將香港一島給予大英君主暨嗣後世襲主位者常遠據守主掌，任便立法治理。

4）一、因大清欽差大憲等於道光十九年二月間經將大英國領事官及民人等強留粵省，赫以死罪，索出鴉片以為贖命，今大皇帝准以洋銀六百萬圓償補原價。

5）一、凡大英商民在粵貿易，向例全歸額設行商，亦稱公行者承辦，今大皇帝准以嗣後不必仍照向例，乃凡有英商等赴各該口貿易者，勿論與何商交易，均聽其便；且向例額設行商等內有累欠英商甚多無措清還者，今酌定洋銀三百萬圓，作為商欠之數，准明由中國官為償還。

6）一、因大清欽命大臣等向大英官民人等不公強辦，致須撥發軍士討求伸理，今酌定水陸軍費洋銀一千二百萬圓，大皇帝准為償補，惟自道光二十一年六月十五日以後，英國因贖各城收過銀兩之數，大英全權公使大臣為君主准可按數扣除。

7）一、以上三條酌定銀數共貳千壹百萬圓應如何分期交清開列於左：

此時交銀六百萬圓；

癸卯年六月間交銀三百萬圓，十二月間交銀三百萬圓，共銀六百萬圓；

甲辰年六月間交銀二百五十萬圓，十二月間交銀二百五十萬圓，共銀五百萬圓；

乙巳年六月間交銀二百萬圓，十二月間交銀二百萬圓，共銀四百萬圓；

自壬寅年起至乙巳年止，四年共交銀二千一百萬圓。倘有按期未能交足之數，則酌定每年每百圓加息五圓。

8）一、凡系大英國人，無論本國、屬國軍民等，今在中國所管轄各地方被禁者，大清大皇帝准即釋放。

9）一、凡系中國人，前在英人所據之邑居住者，與英人有來往者，或有跟隨及俟候英國官人者，均由大皇帝俯降御㫖，謄錄天下，恩准免罪；凡系中國人，為英國事被拿監禁受難者，亦加恩釋放。

10）一、前第二條內言明開關俾英國商民居住通商之廣州等五處，應納進口、出口貨稅、餉費，均宜秉公議定則例，由部頒發曉示，以便英商按例交納；今又議定，英國貨物自在某港按例納稅後，即准由中國商人遍運天下，而路所經過稅關不得加重稅例，只可按估價則例若干，每兩加稅不過分。

11）一、議定英國住中國之總管大員，與大清大臣無論京內、京外者，有文書來往，用照㑹字様；英國屬員，用申陳字様；大臣批復用札行字様；兩國屬員往來，必當平行照會。若兩國商賈上達官憲，不在議內，仍用稟明字様為著。

12）一、俟奉大清大皇帝允准和約各條施行，並以此時准交之六百萬圓交清，大英水陸軍士當即退出江寧、京口等處江面，並不再行攔阻中國各省商賈貿易。至鎮海之招寶山，亦將退讓。惟有定海縣之舟山海島、廈門廳之古浪嶼小島，仍歸英兵暫為駐守；迨及所議洋銀全數交清，而前議各海口均已開闗俾英人通商後，即將駐守二處軍士退出，不復佔據。

13）一、以上各條均闗議和要約，應俟大臣等分別奏明大清大皇帝、大英君主各用朱筆親筆批准後，即速行相交，俾兩國分執一冊，以昭信守；惟兩國相離遙遠，不得一旦而到，是以另繕二冊，先由大清欽差便宜行事大臣等、大英欽奉全權公使大臣各為君上定事，蓋用闗防印信，各執一冊為據，俾即日按照和約開載之條，施行妥辦無礙矣。要至和約者。

道光二十二年七月二十四日即英國記年之一千八百四十二年八月二十九日由江寧省會行大英君主汗華囇船上鈐闗防
