一、在中华人民共和国政府和美利坚合众国政府发表的一九七九年一月一日建立外交关系的联合公报中，美利坚合众国承认中华人民共和国政府是中国的唯一合法政府，并承认中国的立场，即只有一个中国，台湾是中国的一部分。在此范围内，双方同意，美国人民将同台湾人民继续保持文化、商务和其他非官方关系。在此基础上，中美两国关系实现了正常化。在中华人民共和国政府和美利坚合众国政府发表的一九七九年一月一日建立外交关系的联合公报中，美利坚合众国承认中华人民共和国政府是中国的唯一合法政府，并承认中国的立场，即只有一个中国，台湾是中国的一部分。在此范围内，双方同意，美国人民将同台湾人民继续保持文化、商务和其他非官方关系。在此基础上，中美两国关系实现了正常化。 

In the Joint Communique on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations on January 1, 1979, issued by the Government of the United States of America and the People’s Republic of China, the United States of America recognized the Government of the People’s Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China, and it acknowledged the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China. Within that context, the two sides agreed that the people of the United States would continue to maintain cultural, commercial, and other unofficial relations with the people of Taiwan. On this basis, relations between the United States and China were normalized.

二、美国向台湾出售武器的问题在两国谈判建交的过程中没有得到解决。双方的立场不一致，中方声明在正常化以后将再次提出这个问题。双方认识到这一问题将会严重妨碍中美关系的发展，因而在赵总理与里根总统以及黄华副总理兼外长与亚历山大·黑格国务卿于一九八一年十月会见时以及在此以后，双方进一步就此进行了讨论。

The question of United States arms sales to Taiwan was not settled in the course of negotiations between the two countries on establishing diplomatic relations. The two sides held differing positions, and the Chinese side stated that it would raise the issue again following normalization. Recognizing that this issue would seriously hamper the development of United States – China relations, they have held further discussions on it, during and since the meetings between President Ronald Reagan and Premier Zhao and between Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig, Jr. and Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Huang in October 1981.

三、互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不干涉内政是指导中美关系的根本原则。一九七二年二月二十八日的上海公报确认了这些原则。一九七九年一月一日生效的建交公报又重申了这些原则。双方强调声明，这些原则仍是指导双方关系所有方面的原则。

Respect for each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and non-interference in each other’s internal affairs constitute the fundamental principles guiding United States China relations. These principles were confirmed in the Shanghai Communique of February 28, 1972 and reaffirmed in the Joint Communique on the Establishment Of Diplomatic Relations which came into effect on January 1, 1979. Both sides emphatically state that these principles continue to govern all aspects of their relations.

四、中国政府重申，台湾问题是中国的内政。一九七九年一月一日中国发表的告台湾同胞书宣布了争取和平统一祖国的大政方针。一九八一年九月三十日中国提出的九点方针是按照这一大政方针争取和平解决台湾问题的进一步重大努力。

The Chinese Government reiterates that the question of Taiwan is China’s internal affair. The Message to Compatriots in Taiwan issued by China on January 1, 1979 promulgated a fundamental policy of striving for peaceful reunification of the motherland. The Nine-Point Proposal put forward by China on September 30, 1981 represented a further major effort under this fundamental policy to strive for a peaceful solution to the Taiwan question.

五、美国政府非常重视它与中国的关系，并重申，它无意侵犯中国的主权和领土完整，无意干涉中国的内政，也无意执行"两个中国"或"一中一台"政策。美国政府理解并欣赏一九七九年一月一日中国发表的告台湾同胞书和一九八一年九月三十日中国提出的九点方针中所表明的中国争取和平解决台湾问题的政策。台湾问题上出现的新形势也为解决中美两国在美国售台武器问题上的分歧提供了有利的条件。

The United States Government attaches great importance to its relations with China, and reiterates that it has no intention of infringing on Chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity, or interfering in China’s internal affairs, or pursuing a policy of “two Chinas” or “one China, one Taiwan.” The United States Government understands and appreciates the Chinese policy of striving for a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan question as indicated in China’s Message to Compatriots in Taiwan issued on January 1, 1979 and the Nine-Point Proposal put forward by China on September 30, 1981. The new situation which has emerged with regard to the Taiwan question also provides favorable conditions for the settlement of United States – China differences over United States arms sales to Taiwan.

六、考虑到双方的上述声明，美国政府声明，它不寻求执行一项长期向台湾出售武器的政策，它向台湾出售的武器在性能和数量上将不超过中美建交后近几年供应的水平，它准备逐步减少它对台湾的武器出售，并经过一段时间导致最后的解决。在作这样的声明时，美国承认中国关于彻底解决这一问题的一贯立场。

Having in mind the foregoing statements of both sides, the United States Government states that it does not seek to carry out a long-term policy of arms sales to Taiwan, that its arms sales to Taiwan will not exceed, either in qualitative or in quantitative terms, the level of those supplied in recent years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and China, and that it intends gradually to reduce its sale of arms to Taiwan, leading, over a period of time, to a final resolution. In so stating, the United States acknowledges China’s consistent position regarding the thorough settlement of this issue.

七、为了使美国售台武器这个历史遗留的问题，经过一段时间最终得到解决，两国政府将尽一切努力，采取措施，创造条件，以利于彻底解决这个问题。

In order to bring about, over a period of time, a final settlement of the question of United States arms sales to Taiwan, which is an issue rooted in history, the two Governments will make every effort to adopt measures and create conditions conducive to the thorough settlement of this issue.

八、中美关系的发展不仅符合两国人民的利益，而且也有利于世界和平与稳定。双方决心本着平等互利的原则，加强经济、文化、教育、科技和其他方面的联系，为继续发展中美两国政府和人民之间的关系共同作出重大努力。

The development of United States – China relations is not only in the interests of the two peoples but also conducive to peace and stability in the world. The two sides are determined, on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, to strengthen their ties in the economic, cultural, educational, scientific, technological and other fields and make strong, joint efforts for the continued development of relations between the Governments and peoples of the United States and China.

九、为了使中美关系健康发展和维护世界和平、反对侵略扩张，两国政府重申上海公报和建交公报中双方一致同意的各项原则。双方将就共同关心的双边问题和国际问题保持接触并进行适当的磋商。

In order to bring about the healthy development of United States – China relations, maintain world peace and oppose aggression and expansion, the two Governments reaffirm the principles agreed on by the two sides in the Shanghai Communique and the Joint Communique on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations. The two sides will maintain contact and hold appropriate consultations on bilateral and international issues of common interest.
